I am a 21 year old software developer in London originally from Yorkshire and graduated from Newcastle. 
My passion is my work and recently I have grown found of Javascript and front-end web applications (and also
full-stack with the help of NodeJS). I am also an avid gamer with a penchant for MMOs. 

This site is created with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub 
([albeit not GitHub Page's Jekyll](http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html)).
