I am a 23 year old software developer in London originally from Yorkshire and graduated from Newcastle.
My passion is my work and recently I have grown fond of Javascript and front-end web applications (and also
full-stack with the help of NodeJS). I am also an avid gamer with a penchant for MMOs.

This site is created with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
